#IHME Analysis of Telemedicine in the United States during the Covid-19 pandemicThis code was written to conduct a cross-sectional analysis of telemedicine use and policies in the United States during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data, technology, and services used in the generation of these research findings were generously supplied pro bono by the COVID-19 Research Database partners, who are acknowledged at?https://covid19researchdatabase.org/. The code was designed to run within the Amazon Workspace set up and provided through the Covid-19 Research Database; it will not function outside of this environment. The duration of this project was from August 2022 to January 2024.
